## Technical Implementation Details 🔧

### Core Files Modified

#### `static/index.html`
```javascript
// Interactive feature cards with onclick handlers
function handleFeatureClick(feature) {
    const responses = {
        'weather': "I can help you check weather conditions for any location!",
        'tasks': "I can help you manage your tasks and to-do lists!",
        'calendar': "I can help you manage your calendar and schedule!", 
        'entertainment': "I can tell you jokes, provide quotes, and share fun facts!",

    };
    
    showNotification(responses[feature] || "Feature selected!");
}

// Enhanced quick action buttons
const quickActions = [
    { text: "What can you do?", action: () => sendMessage("What can you do?") },
    { text: "Weather", action: () => sendMessage("What's the weather in Tirunelveli?") },
    { text: "Joke", action: () => sendMessage("Tell me a joke") },

```

#### `core/decision_engine.py`
```python
# Fixed personalized response interference
skill_intents = ['weather', 'forecast', 'joke', 'quote', 'automotive', 'task_management', 'calendar']

# Only check personalized responses for conversational intents
if intent not in skill_intents:
    # Check for personalized responses
    if 'conversation_history' in memory_data:
        for entry in memory_data['conversation_history'][-10:]:
            # ... personalized response logic
```

#### `skills/automotive_skill.py`
```python
# Complete automotive assistant
class AutomotiveSkill:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vehicle_db = {
            "Honda City": {"price": "11.5-16.5 lakhs", "type": "Sedan"},
            "Maruti Swift": {"price": "6-9 lakhs", "type": "Hatchback"},
            "Tata Nexon": {"price": "8-15 lakhs", "type": "Compact SUV"},
            # ... 5 more vehicles
