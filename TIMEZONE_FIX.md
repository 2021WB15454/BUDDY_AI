# 🕐 TIMEZONE FIX - Quick Setup Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Your hosted BUDDY AI was showing wrong time (UTC server time) instead of your local time.

## ✅ Solution Implemented
Added timezone support to automatically show correct local time.

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### For Render:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your BUDDY AI service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add new environment variable:
   - **Key**: `TIMEZONE`
   - **Value**: `Asia/Kolkata` (or your timezone)
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Render will automatically redeploy

### For Railway:
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add: `TIMEZONE = Asia/Kolkata`
5. Save and redeploy

### For Heroku:
1. Go to your Heroku dashboard
2. Select your app
3. Go to "Settings" → "Config Vars"
4. Add: `TIMEZONE = Asia/Kolkata`
5. App will restart automatically

## 🌍 Common Timezones

- **India**: `Asia/Kolkata`
